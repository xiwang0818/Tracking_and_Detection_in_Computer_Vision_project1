# Tracking_and_Detection_in_Computer_Vision_project1
This is one of my project in my Praktikum ,Tracking and Detection in Computer Vision, at Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality, Technical University of Munich.  
Task1 is to extract SIFT keypoints. In this task I visualized the model, the camera postion and also the SIFT keypoints in one 3D space.  
Task2 is to realize the pose estimation with PnP and RANSAC.  
Task3, different from previous task, is to do the pose refinement with non-linear optimization method(IRLS Algorithm-----Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares). This method is a robust version of the Levenberg-Marquart(LM) optimization algorithm, which itself is a mixture of the Gauss-Newton method(GN) and simple gradient descent.
